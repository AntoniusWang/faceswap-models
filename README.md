Models for deepfakes/faceswap

See https://github.com/deepfakes/faceswap for the main repo

# Versioning
Add model tags as follows:
`v<major>.<minor>.<patch>`
Where: 
`<major>` is the section:
```
1 - Extract
2 - Train
3 - Convert
```
`<minor>` is the model identifier (should never change for different iterations of the same model).
`<patch>` is the version number of the model (start at 0 and iterate for new versions).
